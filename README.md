Here is a complete summary of your Titanic dataset project based on the files you provided (train.csv, test.csv, and gender_submission.csv):


---

📝 Objective:

To build a machine learning model that predicts whether a passenger survived or not during the Titanic disaster using the given dataset.


---

🧠 Skills Applied:

Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Feature Engineering

Supervised Machine Learning (Classification)

Model Evaluation and Tuning

CSV handling & submission formatting



---

📊 Dataset:

1. train.csv – Contains 891 rows of labeled training data with features like age, gender, class, etc.


2. test.csv – Contains 418 rows of data to predict survival status.


3. gender_submission.csv – A sample submission file showing expected format for predictions.




---

🧰 Tools & Libraries:

Python

Pandas – Data handling

NumPy – Numerical operations

Matplotlib & Seaborn – Data visualization

Scikit-learn – Machine learning models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, etc.)



---

✅ Results:

A predictive model is built using training data.

Survival predictions are generated for the test dataset.

Final output is saved in a submission file matching gender_submission.csv format.



---

📁 Files:

train.csv: Training dataset (with labels).

test.csv: Test dataset (without labels).

gender_submission.csv: Sample submission.

submission.csv: Your output predictions file for submission (generated by your code).
